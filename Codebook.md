The file tidyData.txt is a processed subset of the original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set produced by UCI Machine Learning repository. It followed a series of steps including:

1.Merging the training and the test subjects into a single dataset.
2.Extracting only the measurements corresponding to the mean (Mean) and standard deviation (std) for each available measurement.
3.Joining the subjects with the activities performed by the subjects with the measurements from the dataset.
4.Evaluating the mean per subject and activity of the available meassurements and sorting by subject and activity.
5.Saving the resulting dataset in a text file.
6.Saving the dataset column names in a text file.

The resulting tidy dataset contains 66 columns of averaged information (per subject and activity) corresponding to the Mean and std of different meassurements for a total of 180 observations (30 subjects x 6 activities). These observations include meassurements in Time and Frequency of magnitude (Mag) and components in X,Y and Z direction for the linear acceleration (Acc), angular acceleration (Gyro), linear jerk (AccJerk) and angular jerk (GyroJerk) for both Body and Gravity components. Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the Subject and Activity.
